# Bootstrap-Portfolio-C3

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 3 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to re-create my portfolio site, from the Module 2 Challenge - https://aireytf.github.io/Week2-Challenge-Portfolio/

The original portfolio was guided by the Demo provided in the following screenshots:

The further version of my portfolio, for this challenge, was required to feature the following:

A Navigation bar:
- A navigation menu at the top.
- Include links that are applicable to my portfolio.
- Links should navigate to the appropriate sections.
  

A hero section:
- A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and any other info.
  

A work section:
- A section displaying my work in grid.
- Use bootstrap cards for each project.
- The description should give a brief overview of the work.
- Each project links to my class project work.
  

A skills section
- Listing out the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.
- For this section, I have implemented a custom BootScrap list, to show how I would display the number of professional testimonials I have for very skills. This will, of course, be updated with content in the future, as I progress with this course and as a developer.


An about / contact section.
- An "About Me" section with Contact links in the same row.


A footer section.

N.B: 
- All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
- All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

I, also, chose to include the CV section (from my first portfolio) in my header (though this was beyond the minimum required features for this challenge). I will include a link to my CV, as I update this portfolio overtime.
